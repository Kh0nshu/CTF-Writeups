# CTF/HackTheBox Writeups
This repository will contain all my CTF and HackTheBox Writeups
## Format
It will be composed of notes that I take *while* I'm solving the problem, including the dead ends I reach. 
And if I get really stuck and I really need to look at the answer then it will have an explanation of what 
I did wrong and what was the correct way to go about it.
